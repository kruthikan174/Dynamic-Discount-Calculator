**Minimizing Waste | Maximizing Profit**

---

#### 👩‍💻 Project by: Kruthika N (1RV23CS115)

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement
> Retailers, supermarkets, and food suppliers lose millions due to expired perishable goods, inefficient stock rotation, and incorrect pricing strategies.  
> Traditional inventory systems don’t predict spoilage or dynamically adjust prices, leading to waste and lost revenue.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Predict spoilage likelihood of perishable items using key factors like expiry date, stock level, and sales velocity.
- Recommend dynamic discounts using rule-based and ML-based methods to optimize sell-through.
- Minimize inventory waste while maximizing profit margins.
- Provide an intuitive dashboard for retailers to make data-driven pricing decisions.
